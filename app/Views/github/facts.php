            <h4><a href="">Green</a></h4>
            <p>My favorite color. I was raised in the province and grew up surrounded by nature, so I grew up very fond of the color green.</p>

            <h4><a href="">Cats Over Dogs</a></h4>
            <p>Cats suit my lifestyle and personality better. Dogs require so much of my time and energy and as an introvert, I don't have 
              that much energy to spare.

            <h4><a href="">Troubleshooter of the Family</a></h4>
            <p>Out of everyone in my family, I am the most familiar with technology. 
              Whether it's troubleshooting mobile phones or setting up the wifi, my family relies 
              on me to understand technology.

            <h4><a href="">Little Helper</a></h4>
            <p>I've been helping my mother with our small family business since 11th grade. Sometimes I do homework and school projects while 
              watching over our delicacy store.

            <h4><a href="">Personal Tutor</a></h4>
            <p>I help my cousins with their homework, both high school and college students. 
              I also explain to them their lessons since they are having a hard time understanding them all on their own.

            <h4><a href="">Hyperfixations</a></h4>
            <p>I have a long history of hyperfixations. When I was a child, I was obsessed with cartoons. 
              In high school, I was an anime weeb. 
              During the pandemic, I was fixated on Minecraft-related content. 
              Nowadays, I am a huge fan of Vtubers.

            <h4><a href="">Games</a></h4>
            <p>I mostly play gacha games like Genshin Impact and Twisted Wonderland, but I've never spent
             money on these types of games. I've also played some multiplayer online battle arena games. 
             I've only played mobile games because it's more convenient, 
             I don't have a personal computer, and my laptop is purely for school work.

            <h4><a href="">Music</a></h4>
            <p>I have experience in playing the keyboard, but I have forgotten already. I have a ukulele, but I rarely 
              play it anymore because I've been busy. When it comes to music taste, I listen to different genres. 
              If I like a particular song, I will listen to it regardless of whether the genre is unfamiliar to me.

            <h4><a href="">Writing</a></h4>
            <p>I don't read that much books, but I have written a number of literary works in high school.
               These includes poems, short stories, essays, and feature writings.

            <h4><a href="">Cooking</a></h4>
            <p>I can only cook simple foods like corndogs, pizza rolls, fried rice, omurice, egg rolls, etc.
               I can also make simple desserts like ice cream, choco truffles, and homemade mini pie.

            <h4><a href="">Art</a></h4>
            <p>I have been making some fanart for the people I look up to. 
             I've been making digital art, vector art, coffee paintings, and traditional art.
             I also have experience in mural painting because of school.
